Credit risk pertains to the potential that a borrower may fail to fulfill their loan obligations, posing a substantial concern for 
lenders like banks and financial institutions due to the possibility of financial losses, impacting profitability and stability.
Evaluating and managing this risk is pivotal in lending operations, involving the utilization of diverse techniques and models. 
Factors such as credit history, repayment capability, loan terms, and annual income are scrutinized to assess this risk.

Various forms of credit risk include default risk, where borrowers may not meet payment obligations, credit spread risk, which
involves losses due to widening credit spreads, counterparty risk, concentration risk, and country risk linked to investing or 
lending in specific countries due to political or economic instability.

Credit risk assessment employs several methodologies, including credit scoring models utilizing historical data and predictive 
variables, credit rating agencies assigning credit ratings based on repayment capacity, financial statement analysis, collateral 
evaluation, and consideration of qualitative factors like management quality and industry outlook.

Many organizations, especially financial institutions, evaluate credit risk for existing and potential customers, often leveraging
machine learning to analyze customer data for risk profiling. Machine learning aids in determining the probability of default and 
assessing the financial impact on lenders in such scenarios.

In data analysis projects, the application of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests and XGBoost aims to model and 
assess risks within datasets. The objective is to explore the efficacy of these algorithms in analyzing data and providing insights
into various risk types, thereby enhancing lending decisions and risk management practices.

In this credit risk modeling project, the goal is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, 
and XGBoost to model and assess risks within a dataset. The primary objective is to investigate whether these algorithms can 
effectively analyze the data and provide insights into various types of risks.
